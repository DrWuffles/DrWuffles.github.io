title: Dumping Game Cards
---

This section is for dumping Game Cards using GodMode9i so they can be played on emulators, flashcards, or your SD card via nds-bootstrap.

## 需要准备
- The Game Card of the title you would like to dump
- Your Nintendo DSi console with [Unlaunch](installing-unlaunch.html) installed

## 操作步骤
### 第一节 - SD 卡设置

1. 下载最新版本的 [GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases)
1. 从 GodMode9i 目录中解压 `GodMode9i.nds` 并复制到你SD卡的任意位置

### 第二节——DSi上的操作
1. Launch GodMode9i
1. Ensure the Game Card is inserted into the console
1. Select the "NDS GAMECARD" option in GodMode9i
1. Select what you want to dump
   - The "Trimmed" options for the ROM will dump a smaller file that can save SD card space, however they won't work for most patches such as ROM hacks
1. Repeat steps 2-4 for all Game Cards you wish to dump

::: tip

The dumped Game Cards will be found in `sd:/gm9i/out`.
